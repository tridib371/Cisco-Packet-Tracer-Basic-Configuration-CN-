## 🧠 Example Practice — VLSM Subnetting

Example network: 192.168.10.0/24
Requirement:

Dept A: 60 hosts

Dept B: 30 hosts

Dept C: 14 hosts

Dept D: 6 hosts

| Department | Required Hosts | Subnet Mask | Subnet Address | Range       |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| A          | 60             | /26         | 192.168.10.0   | .1 – .62    |
| B          | 30             | /27         | 192.168.10.64  | .65 – .94   |
| C          | 14             | /28         | 192.168.10.96  | .97 – .110  |
| D          | 6              | /29         | 192.168.10.112 | .113 – .118 |
